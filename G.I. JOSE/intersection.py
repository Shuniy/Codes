Intersection:  Given two(singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the interÂ­
secting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth
node of the first linked list is the exact same node(by reference) as the jth node of the second
linked list, then they are intersecting.
Hints:  # 20, #45, #55, #65, #76, #93, #111, #120, #129

# one way is to store the memory address in hashtable and check coinciding memory addresses

# another way is to check if when traversing if the nodes have same next address then, that node is intersection
# also basic check is to check the tail if the memory address is different then no interesection
# time : O(n) : space : O(1)
