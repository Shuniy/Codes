What is the running time of Radix Sort?
Let there be d digits in input integers. Radix Sort takes O(d*(n+b)) time where b is 
the base for representing numbers, for example, for decimal system, b is 10. What is 
the value of d? If k is the maximum possible value, then d would be O(logb(k)). So 
overall time complexity is O((n+b) * logb(k)). Which looks more than the time 
complexity of comparison based sorting algorithms for a large k. Let us first 
limit k. Let k <= nc where c is a constant. In that case, the complexity becomes 
O(nLogb(n)). But it still doesnâ€™t beat comparison based sorting algorithms.

What if we make value of b larger?. What should be the value of b to make the time 
complexity linear? If we set b as n, we get the time complexity as O(n). In other 
words, we can sort an array of integers with range from 1 to nc if the numbers are 
represented in base n (or every digit takes log2(n) bits).

Is Radix Sort preferable to Comparison based sorting algorithms like Quick-Sort?
If we have log2n bits for every digit, the running time of Radix appears to be 
better than Quick Sort for a wide range of input numbers. The constant factors 
hidden in asymptotic notation are higher for Radix Sort and Quick-Sort uses hardware 
caches more effectively. Also, Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine and 
counting sort takes extra space to sort numbers.
